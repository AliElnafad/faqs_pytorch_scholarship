# Few details about the course contents and upcoming activities

**Q1: Are there any colab projects for the challenge in near future?**
-   There will be an opportunity for collaboration in our project showcase that will happen towards the end of Phase 1. In the meantime, you can colab on ideas to enrich this community whether that be host an AMA, a live webinar - pitch us your best ideas!

**Q2: Just wondering if it matters that we log into the course regularly (in the sense of a certain number of times per week) for moving onto phase 2? As, due to other commitments, many people will not be able to do this. I know you want to see steady progress but is it OK if it's once every other week or so?**
-   All that matters is that your coursework and the final Challenge project is completed by the January 9th deadline.  While steady progress is recommended so you don't find yourself in pickle as the deadline draws near, we understand everyone has busy schedules. As was said previously - while it's not mandatory to devote huge chunks at a time to either your coursework or your community involvement even if you're able to devote 15-20 min here and there we see that and appreciate it as every little bit helps!

**Q3: Can I access course Material After January?**
-   After the deadline passes you'll retain static access to the coursework - meaning it will be viewable but you will not be able to resubmit the last Challenge project. 

**Q4: What are some other student leader opportunities coming in December?**
-   There is a [Tandem program](https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/pytorch-scholarship-facebook/community?authuser=0#h.p_k7Juqt2topbl) is coming soon! 

**Q5: Are there any recommended timeline where people are expected to be at what time so as to monitor our progress?**
- There are no specific deadlines, other than the final deadline of Jan 9, 2019. People are suggested to go at their own pace, and working a few hours evryday is better than cramping all the content in one week.

**Q6:  Concerning slack workspace, is there in the a near future a plan to upgrade into "Standard plan" for Udacity slack?**
-   Unfortunately, we will not be moving this workspace to a paid plan.

**Q7: How much does active participation here count on one getting the nanodegree?** 
- Unfortunately, we can not disclose the exact weight that it has. But it matters a lot. Besides, think of it this way: if you explain what you are learning, you know it better too. So you are helping us and learning more as well, and making connections and friends. It is heaven on earth, or close to it :grinning: It is a win-win situation.

**Q8: Is there will be any project ..., where all the participants can collaborate together ?**
- Once your Challenge coursework is finished and your Challenge project complete (NOTE: that should be your number 1 priority) you can work on a side project to showcase what you've learned. We will have a formal program around that so start thinking of ideas now! You can find classmates to collab with in the #side-projects channel!

**Q9:  Will the materials be available after the course ends?**
-   You will access after the course ends and only retain static access to this material - meaning you can view it but you won't be able to resubmit your final Challenge project. Just a note that this Challenge project is one of the things that differentiates this Challenge from the free course!. 

**Q10: what's the way to inform the staff when we find issues or bugs in the course?**
-    Please use our [Bug Reporting](https://goo.gl/forms/Pd7EiJEqYBjTCZR83) form.

**Q11: At the end of this great challenge, will we receive a certificate for completing all the materials + the lab with success?**
-   Unfortunate there isn't any certificate. You only receive a certificate after completing and graduating the complete ND course. However, Udacity will provide you with wordings to show share you participation in the challenge course.

**Q12: What counts to participation?**
-   Slack and our private Facebook group are the only platforms we are monitoring for your participation. We are using facebook to help you find local meetups and for you to post your meetup pics for the Facebook team to also see!

**Q13: After the challenge is ,we still have this group and channels?**
-   We will likely keep this Slack workspace up for a limited time but past Scholarship have shown us that students leave pretty quickly and then the workspace gets quiet.
